# OLD Version Files

This folder contains files from the previous version (V1) of ARCGen that have been superseded by the improved V2 implementation.

## Files in this folder:

### `ARCGen.py`
- **Description**: Original ARCGen V1 implementation
- **Status**: DEPRECATED - Replaced by `arcgen_v2.py`
- **Issues**: Contains security vulnerabilities and performance issues that have been fixed in V2

### `OLD_README.md`
- **Description**: Original README file for V1
- **Status**: DEPRECATED - Replaced by main `README.md`

### `migrate_v1_to_v2.py`
- **Description**: Migration script to help users transition from V1 to V2
- **Status**: LEGACY TOOL - May be useful for historical reference

## Why these files were moved:

The V1 implementation (`ARCGen.py`) contained **12 critical security vulnerabilities and bugs** that have been completely resolved in V2:

1. Path traversal vulnerabilities
2. Unsafe file writing practices  
3. Missing input validation
4. Race conditions
5. Memory inefficiencies
6. Missing error handling
7. Code quality issues

## Recommendation:

**Use `arcgen_v2.py` instead** - It's secure, robust, and feature-complete with:
- ✅ All security vulnerabilities patched
- ✅ Enhanced performance and reliability
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Multi-provider AI support (DeepSeek, OpenAI)
- ✅ Advanced configuration management
- ✅ Comprehensive backup system

**Note**: These files are kept for historical reference only. Do not use V1 in production environments.
